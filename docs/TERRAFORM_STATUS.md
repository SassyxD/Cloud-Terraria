# Terraform Installation Status

## ‚úÖ Current Status

You have successfully installed Terraform in the `infra/terraform` folder. The configuration files have been cleaned up and are ready to use.

## üîß Configuration Fixed

I've resolved the duplicate provider configuration issues:

- **Removed duplicates**: Cleaned up `main.tf` and `versions.tf`
- **Consolidated providers**: Single provider configuration in `versions.tf`
- **Added default tags**: Proper resource tagging for cost tracking

## üìã Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Complete Terraform Initialization

The provider download was interrupted. Complete it by running:

```powershell
cd d:\terraria\infra\terraform
.\terraform.exe init
```

Wait for it to complete (downloads AWS and Archive providers ~100MB).

### 2. Validate Configuration

Once initialization completes:

```powershell
.\terraform.exe validate
```

Should return: `Success! The configuration is valid.`

### 3. Plan Infrastructure (Optional - Review Only)

To see what would be created (without actually creating anything):

```powershell
.\terraform.exe plan
```

This will show you all the AWS resources that would be created.

## üöÄ Ready for Production Deployment

Once validation passes, you can deploy to AWS:

### Option A: Development (SQLite Database)
- Keep current setup
- No AWS resources needed
- Continue with existing `.env` file

### Option B: Production (AWS RDS Database)

1. **Create terraform variables file**:
   ```hcl
   # Create: infra/terraform/terraform.tfvars
   enable_rds = true
   rds_password = "YourSecurePassword123!"
   region = "us-east-1"  # or your preferred region
   ```

2. **Deploy infrastructure**:
   ```powershell
   .\terraform.exe apply
   ```

3. **Get database connection string**:
   ```powershell
   .\terraform.exe output rds_connection_string
   ```

4. **Update your .env file**:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@endpoint:5432/terrakit"
   ```

5. **Run database migration**:
   ```powershell
   cd d:\terraria
   npx prisma migrate dev --name "production-init"
   ```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Terraform init fails:
- Check internet connection
- Try running as administrator
- Delete `.terraform` folder and retry

### If AWS authentication fails:
- Run `aws configure` to set up credentials
- Ensure you have proper AWS permissions

### If validation fails:
- Check all `.tf` files for syntax errors
- Ensure all variables are defined in `variables.tf`
